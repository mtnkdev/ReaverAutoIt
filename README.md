### Information
I've spent the past two years occasionally  how to stress-test my routers and to see how secure they were with WPA/WPA2 passphrase protection, and I've come to realize i've done nothing but overcomplicated the entire proccess. The goal of this script is to resolve that for others and just get the job done.
